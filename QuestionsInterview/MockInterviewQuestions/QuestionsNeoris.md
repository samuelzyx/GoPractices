- Explain what Go is. 
Golang is a programming language based in C, that is simple to read, write and learn and is one of the best regarding concurrency use of resources. 

- Which skills are you working on related to Go? 
Normally Golang is used for Backend Developers, is used to create endpoints, microservices, all the logic behind the scenes regarding project of IT 

- Which soft skills are you working on related to your work with Go? 
Good communication, teamwork, problem-solving, adaptability, creativity, thinking and keeping simple things. 

- Which technical skills do you think are important for programmers who use Golang? 
Backend skills, create endpoints, design patterns, persistence data, logic, algoritms 

- What is syntax like in GO?
Syntaxis in go is specified using Extended Backus Naur Form (EBNF)

- Does Go support generic programming? 
Yes, in the last version are supported 

- Is Go case-sensitive? 
Yes itÂ´s 

- Name the key built-in supports in Go.  
Go support for built-in: concurrency with goroutines and channels, efficient garbage collector, a robust standard library, and features like slices and maps for streamlined data manipulation. 

- Explain whether Go supports type inheritance. 
Golang is not object-oriented programming so dont support inheritance. 

- Explain whether Go supports operator overloading. 
Go does not support function or method overloading in any form 

- Describe your experience with Go. 
I have 3 years' experience as a Golang Developer and normally we use Golang to create microservices and expose and consume API endpoints, made also connections to the databases and deploying solution to Google Cloud Platform.  

- Have you ever experienced any difficulty using the programming language Go? 
Yes, at the beginning i faced some issues regarding the pass of parameters in functions because sometimes we need to pass the point of reference instead of the object itself, and same returning multiple values with different datatypes. 

- Which factors make Golang a fast language? 
Garbage collectors help us with the performance of the resource memory address, also the use of concurrency in some processes gives us great performance. 

- Have you worked on any side projects using Go as a programming language? 
Yes, I had the opportunity to create some microservices from scratch, maintain others and resolve bugs. 

- Explain what a static type variable declaration is in Go 
A static type variable declaration provides assurance to the compiler that there is one variable available with the given type and name so that the compiler can proceed for further compilation without requiring the complete detail of the variable. 

- Explain what a dynamic type variable declaration is in Go. 
A dynamic type variable declaration requires the compiler to interpret the type of the variable based on the value passed to it 

- Explain what a string literal is. 
A string literal represents a string constant obtained from concatenating a sequence of characters could be separated in raw string involved beetwen back quotation and interpreted involved between double quotation 

- Explain what a run is 
A run represents a single character written with single quotation mark 

- Explain what a raw string literal is. 
Raw string literals are every character sequence included between back quotes `foo` 

- Explain what interpreted string literals are. 
Interpreted string literals are character sequences between double quotes, as in "bar" 

- Name five types of data that Golang uses. 
int, float, string, rune, bool.  

- Explain what packages are. 
A package in Go is essentially a named collection of one or more related .go files. In Go, the primary purpose of packages is to help you isolate and reuse code. Every .go file that you write should begin with a package {name} statement which indicates the name of the package that the file is a part of.p 

- Explain what a goroutine is. 
A goroutine is a lightweight thread managed by the Go runtime 

go f(x,y,z) 

Goroutines that need to access to shared memory must be synchronized. 

- Explain what a function closure is. 
A closure is a function value that references variables from outside its body. The function may access and assign to the referenced variables 

- Explain what a Go interface is. 
An interface type is defined as a set of method signatures. A value of interface type can hold any value that implements those methods. 

- Explain what Lvalue is in Golang. 

- Explain what Rvalue is in Golang. 

- Explain what Channel is in Golang. 

- Explain what Channel Buffered and unbuffered is in Golang. 

- Name the only looping construct in Go. 

- Explain what a workspace is in Go. 
- Explain what the GoPATH environment variable is in Go. 
- Explain which symbol represents a pointer in Go. 
- Explain what a type assertion is in Go. 
- Explain what methods are in Golang. 
- What are operators in Go? 
- Explain what constant variables are in Go. 
- Explain what the scope of a variable refers to. 
- Explain what slice refers to in Go. 
- Explain what the GoPATH variable is in Go. 
- Explain what the GoROOT variable is in Go. 
- Explain how you would check variable types at runtime in Go. 
- Explain how you would concatenate a string. 
- Explain how you would create a custom testing suite in Golang. 
- Explain how you would return various values from a function in Go. 
- Explain what you would use the break statement for in Go. 
- Explain for what you would use the continued statement in Go. 
- Explain how you would swap variables in Go. 
- Explain how you would use the Goto statement in Golang. 
- Explain what you would use the switch statement for in Golang. 
- Explain how you would declare multiple variable types in a line of code in Golang. 
- Which syntax is applicable for creating a function in Go? 
- Difference between concurrency and paralellism?
