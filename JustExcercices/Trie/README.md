 Tries are one of the basic tree structures and it’s also asked in coding interview questions. You can see these kind of problems on Leetcode or Hackerrank, which would be something you'll know about if you want to work in software engineering or computer science. Like always, I’ll be explaining the basic concepts first with diagrams, and then, after that we can go do some coding on tries in golang.
